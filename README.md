## Tik-Tac-Toe 3x3 Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for developing a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. The primary goal is to implement this game on the Arduino Uno microcontroller, allowing users to play directly on a microcontroller-based platform. 

## Task Details
This project involves multiple stages:
- Design and implement the logic for a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Deploy the game on an Arduino Uno microcontroller.
- Handle input/output using available hardware components.
- Ensure the game runs efficiently and supports basic user interactions.
- Set up the groundwork for further development and integration with additional hardware.
