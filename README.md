# 1.2. Task details

This project focuses on developing a digital version of tik-tac-toe 3x3, examining the game's fundamental mechanics and implementation techniques. We aim to create an engaging and user-friendly experience by employing modern programming tools and languages. The game will feature an intuitive interface where two players can face off each other by placing their symbols 0 or X on a grid.

# 1.3. Student number and details

Student number: 29.
Game: tik-tac-toe 3x3.

# 1.4. Details about technology, program language, and HW

In this project, I will create a client-server architecture where an Arduino board serves as the server and a client application retrieves information from it. The Arduino will perform all required computations and send the processed results back to the client. Both the Arduino platform and the client application will be developed in C++, ensuring reliable performance and efficient communication between the two components.
